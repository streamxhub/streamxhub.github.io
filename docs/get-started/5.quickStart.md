You can get started with StreamPark in just three simple steps:
- **Step 1**: Environment Preparation
- **Step 2**: StreamPark Installation
- **Step 3**: Deploying a Job

## 1. Environment Preparation

<QuickStartEnvs></QuickStartEnvs>

**Note**: It is assumed that JDK and Scala are already installed locally.

## 2. StreamPark Installation
First, download the latest version of StreamPark from the official website. This guide uses [version 2.1.5](https://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.lua/incubator/streampark/2.1.5/apache-streampark_2.12-2.1.5-incubating-bin.tar.gz?action=download). Download it from: [https://streampark.apache.org/download](https://streampark.apache.org/download)

![streampark_download](/doc/image/quick-start/streampark_download.png)

After downloading, extract it to a local directory, navigate to the `bin` directory, and start StreamPark using the following commands:

```shell
# Extract the StreamPark package.
tar -zxvf apache-streampark_2.12-2.1.5-incubating-bin.tar.gz

# Start StreamPark.
cd apache-streampark_2.12-2.1.5-incubating-bin/bin
./startup.sh
```  

Once started successfully, you will see the following interface:  
![startup-success](/doc/image/quick-start/startup_success.png)

Login to StreamPark at: [http://127.0.0.1:10000](http://127.0.0.1:10000)
> Default credentials: **admin/streampark**

## 3. Deploying Job
Upon first login, you will find a default FlinkSQL job already created. For demonstration purposes, we will run this job in **Standalone mode**. Before doing so, you need to configure the Flink version and associate a Flink cluster.

### 3.1 Configuring the Flink Version
> **Note**: The Flink installation package must be on the same server as the StreamPark service.

First, configure the Flink version by specifying the local Flink installation path. Navigate to: **Settings → Flink Version → New**

### 3.2 Configuring the Flink Cluster
> **Note**: Ensure that the local Flink cluster is already running. You can start it by navigating to the `bin` directory of the extracted Flink package and running `./start-cluster.sh`.

To associate the Flink cluster, navigate to: **Settings → Flink Version → Add**  
![flink_cluster](/doc/image/quick-start/flink_cluster.png)

### 3.3 Configuring the Job
Click on "Job Configuration" to open the job settings page:  
![job_config](/doc/image/quick-start/job_config.png)

Modify the **deployment mode, Flink version, and Flink cluster**, then save the settings:  
![job_config_detail](/doc/image/quick-start/job_config_detail.png)

Click **Deploy**:  
![job_release](/doc/image/quick-start/job_release.png)

Start the job:  
![job_start](/doc/image/quick-start/job_start.png)

After the job starts successfully, the following interface will be displayed:  
![job_start_success](/doc/image/quick-start/job_start_success.png)

You can also navigate to the job details page for more information:

This guide does not cover all features—there's much more for you to explore!

## 4. Possible Issues
If you encounter the following error:  
<font color='red'> ERROR: streampark.workspace.local: "/tmp/streampark" is an invalid path, please reconfigure in ...</font>

You can resolve it by either:
1. Creating a `streampark` folder in the `/tmp` directory, or
2. Modifying the `streampark.workspace.local` property in the `conf/config.yaml` file to point to a valid temporary directory.
