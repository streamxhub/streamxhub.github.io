> To quickly get started with StreamPark, you can either **install and deploy with one click** or **install and deploy manually**.

## 1. One-Click Installation
To install StreamPark with one click, simply copy the following command:
```shell
curl -L https://streampark.apache.org/quickstart.sh | sh
```
If you see the following message, it means the installation and deployment were successful:

The script has already installed StreamPark and the Flink cluster for you. You can log in directly to start jobs.
:::
After logging in, click "Start" to begin the default job.

- **Step 1**: Environment Setup
- **Step 2**: StreamPark Installation

### 2.1 Environment Setup

<QuickStartEnvs></QuickStartEnvs>

**Note**: The default user should already have JDK and Scala installed locally.

### 2.2 StreamPark Installation
First, download the latest version of StreamPark from the official website. The version used in this article is <u><font color='blue'>[2.1.5](https://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.lua/incubator/streampark/2.1.5/apache-streampark_2.12-2.1.5-incubating-bin.tar.gz?action=download)</font></u>, download link: <u><font color='blue'>[https://streampark.apache.org/download](https://streampark.apache.org/download/)</font></u>

After downloading, extract it to a local directory and navigate to the `bin` directory to start StreamPark. The relevant scripts are as follows:
```shell
# Extract the StreamPark installation package.
tar -zxvf apache-streampark_2.12-2.1.5-incubating-bin.tar.gz

# Start StreamPark.
cd apache-streampark_2.12-2.1.5-incubating-bin/bin
./startup.sh
```
After a successful start, the interface will look like this:

### 2.3 Deploy Job
After logging into the system for the first time, you will notice that a default FlinkSQL job has already been created. To better demonstrate, this article uses the Standalone mode to run the job. Before doing that, you need to configure the Flink version and associate the Flink cluster.

#### 2.3.1 Configure Flink Version
:::caution Caution
The Flink installation package must be on the same server as the StreamPark service.
:::

First, configure the Flink version by specifying the path to your local Flink extraction directory. Follow these steps: **Settings Center → Flink Version → New**

#### 2.3.2 Configure Flink Cluster
:::note Note
Ensure that your local Flink cluster is already started (just navigate to the Flink extraction directory’s `bin` directory and run `./start-cluster.sh`).
:::

Associate the Flink cluster by clicking: **Settings Center → Flink Cluster → Add**  
![flink_cluster](/doc/image/quick-start/flink_cluster.png)

#### 2.3.3 Configure Job
Click on Job Configuration to enter the job configuration page:
![job_config](/doc/image/quick-start/job_config.png)

Simply modify the deployment mode, Flink version, and Flink cluster, then save it:
![job_config_detail](/doc/image/quick-start/job_config_detail.png)

Click "Release":
![job_release](/doc/image/quick-start/job_release.png)

Start the job:
![job_start](/doc/image/quick-start/job_start.png)

The page after a successful start looks like this:
![job_start_success](/doc/image/quick-start/job_start_success.png)

You can also go to the details page to view job details:
![job_detail](/doc/image/quick-start/job_detail.png)

Other features are not demonstrated here, but are worth exploring...

## 3. Possible Issues
If you encounter the following error:
:::danger Warning
ERROR: streampark.workspace.local: "/tmp/streampark" is an invalid path, please reconfigure in ...
:::

You may need to directly create the `streampark` folder in the `/tmp` directory of your system or configure the `streampark.workspace.local` property in the `/conf/config.yaml` file with a valid temporary directory path.
