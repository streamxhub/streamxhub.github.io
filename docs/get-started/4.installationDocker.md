## 1. Environment Preparation

To install StreamPark using Docker, you need to prepare the following environment:

<DockerInstallationEnvs></DockerInstallationEnvs>

:::note Note
This guide assumes that `Docker` and `Docker Compose` are already installed.
:::

## 2. Packaging  Image

This section explains how to manually package the image. First, follow the steps below to download the StreamPark source code. After switching branches, place the packaged installation files into the `dist` directory:

```yaml
## Clone the source code to your local machine
git clone https://github.com/apache/streampark.git

## Navigate to the docker directory
cd streampark/docker

## Switch to the desired branch, in this case, the release-2.1.5 branch
git checkout release-2.1.5

## Create the dist directory
mkdir dist
```
:::tip
After creating the `dist` directory, you can place the packaged or downloaded installation files into the `dist` directory. For demonstration purposes, we directly use the installation package downloaded from the official website.

Now you can begin building the image:

```yaml
## Note: Ensure the installation package is placed in the dist directory
# cp path/to/apache-streampark_2.12-2.1.5-incubating-bin.tar.gz dist

## Build the image, note that the image name format is: <apache/streampark>:<version>, ensure to include the "."
docker build -t apache/streampark:2.1.5 .

## After the build, use this command to check if the image has been built successfully
docker images|grep streampark
```

Use the `docker` command to verify that the image was built successfully, as shown below:
![docker_build_success](/doc/image/quick-start/docker_build_success.png)

## 3. Start Service

In the current StreamPark source's `docker` directory, you can start the service using the `docker-compose` command:

```shell
docker-compose up -d
```

After starting, use the following command to check if the StreamPark service is running correctly:

```shell
docker ps -a|grep streampark
```

From the image below, you can see that the StreamPark service has started successfully:
![docker_start_success](/doc/image/quick-start/docker_start_success.png)

To access StreamPark, visit: [http://127.0.0.1:10000](http://127.0.0.1:10000)
:::tip Tip
Login credentials: <strong> admin / streampark </strong>
:::
![login-page](/doc/image/quick-start/login_page.png)

You should see **successful login!**

## 4. Configuration

As seen above, StreamPark is started using the `docker-compose` command. The `docker-compose.yaml` file is a configuration file used to define and manage multi-container Docker applications. Its contents and explanation are as follows:

```yaml
version: '3.8'  

services: 
  streampark:
    image: apache/streampark:2.1.5  # Use the previously built image
    ports:
      - "10000:10000"  # Map port 10000 of the container to port 10000 of the host to allow access to the service on that port
    environment:
      - TZ=Asia/Shanghai  # Container's timezone
      - DATASOURCE_DIALECT=h2   # Set the datasource dialect, supports h2, mysql, pgsql, currently set to h2
                                # If using MySQL or PostgreSQL, set the following parameters:
                                # - DATASOURCE_URL=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/streampark?useSSL=false&useUnicode=true&characterEncoding=UTF-8&allowPublicKeyRetrieval=false&useJDBCCompliantTimezoneShift=true&useLegacyDatetimeCode=false&serverTimezone=GMT%2B8
                                # - DATASOURCE_URL=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/streampark?stringtype=unspecified
                                # - DATASOURCE_USERNAME=root  # Database username
                                # - DATASOURCE_PASSWORD=streampark  # Database password
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock  # Mount the host's Docker socket inside the container to allow interaction with Docker
      - /etc/hosts:/etc/hosts:ro  # Mount the host's /etc/hosts file inside the container, read-only access
      - ~/.kube:/root/.kube:ro    # Mount the host's kube configuration directory inside the container to access the Kubernetes cluster
    privileged: true  # Grant the container higher privileges, typically for scenarios requiring interaction with host resources
    restart: always   # Ensure the container always restarts after crashes or host reboots
    networks:
      - streampark    # Use a custom network named streampark
    healthcheck:  # Set a health check
      test: [ "CMD", "curl", "http://streampark:10000" ]  # Use curl to check if port 10000 of the container is accessible
      interval: 5s  # Health check interval is 5 seconds
      timeout: 5s  # Timeout for each health check is 5 seconds
      retries: 120  # The container will be considered unhealthy after 120 failed health checks

networks:
  streampark:
    driver: bridge  # Use the bridge network driver
```
